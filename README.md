## The Mission
In this assignment I had to provide to users 3 main functionalities:

- Search for movies
- See details of a movie
- Open images of a movie

The following section contains each functionality requirements and how was the approach I took to solve them.

### Search for Movies

*"...implement a search functionality for movies. You will use autocompletion to get a list of movies matching the string that the user inputs, getting some basic information to show to the user about the movies..."*

The results are shown as a grid of [CardViews](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/CardView.html). Each card
